Please create a list of offers from that endpoint:

https://content.sixt.io/codingtasks/offers.json

The work should be done with react/redux and uploaded to a git repo of your choice. As we do not have a proper cross origin header for that endpoint please use something like the Moesif CORS Plugin for development.

1. the offers should be displayed in a responsive grid, each offer-tile should have a square format. Fullsize would maybe result in 4 tiles per row, mobile view would have only two tiles per row.

2. the offers should be sortable by the options in the key ‚sortIndexes‘
